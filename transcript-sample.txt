I’ll follow up with Emma from legal this week.[Fatima]We need to finalize the vendor list by next Friday. Can I ask Tom to lead that?[Tom]Sure. I’ll set up a shortlist review session next Wednesday.[Alex]Also, we still haven’t gotten clarity from IT on the legacy data format. Can someone chase that?[Fatima]I’ll ping Marcus about it today.[John]Great. Let’s aim to have the compliance sign-off and vendor decision locked by end of next week.[Alex]I'll compile today’s meeting notes and send to all by EOD.
